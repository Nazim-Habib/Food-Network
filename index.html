                    is
                    believed that Parsley is a potent herb that helps purify the blood. This is eaten using very tender

                <p>Authentic strudel is made with strudel dough, a labor-intensive, paper-thin dough. To simplify
                    things,
                    we've used store-bought phyllo dough, which is widely available and relatively easy to work with.
